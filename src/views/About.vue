            <p class="page-title">About me</p>
            <p>Each year during the summer holidays while I was in secondary school, my parents used to get me to do a little project, just to keep me entertained during the 6 weeks off school. One of my first projects I did was a scrapbook about Volcanoes. After that, I loved everything to do with Volcanoes, I'd watch documentaries about the Yellowstone super volcano. I had relatives bring me back bits of volcanic rock from holidays, etc. When I grew up, I wanted to be a volcanologist, surely the coolest job ever?</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, I had to visit the school careers officer, to talk about what kind of career I wanted after I left school. Obviously, I said Volcanologist, but she said "Barely anyone becomes a volcanologist, you should pick a better career". Being young and pliable, I just kinda of agreed.</p>

            <p class="page-title">My first website</p>
            <p>My dad encouraged me to do my next project, which was a website for my secondary school. He'd just got some new software, I cant remember exactly what it was, but think along the lines of Microsoft Frontpage. It was a drag and drop editor, typical of the early 2000's. And I built a truly horrible website, but I was proud of it at the time. It had a solid black background, big blocky navigation buttons with a purple marbled texture (bevelled of course), and gifs. Lots of gifs.</p>
            <p>The school "liked" it, and encouraged me to keep going, which I did. After a while, I wanted to know whats going on behind the scenes of the GUI. How does a web page actually work? So every morning, at 6am, before school, I would wake up, quietly turn on the computer and start learning about HTML. Shout-out to W3schools.</p>

        <div class="content-section white-section">
            <p class="page-title">Introduction to the backend</p>
            <p>While still in school, we had the local newspaper come in, asking if anyone wanted to spend some of their time on a Saturday morning learning how to be a reporter. A friend and I signed up, and each Saturday we'd go to another school, and start learning about journalism. We were encouraged to write our own news story, and we could use this super cool webpage to record all our notes.</p>
            <p>The webpage was fascinating. It was just a basic HTML form, but every time I loaded the page, the content in the forms was still there. This was the first introduction to a backend I had. I looked at the filename in the url (because every URL had a filename and extension back then). ".asp". Again, back onto w3schools to look at ASP, and quickly found that it could be used to do loads of cool stuff. Save data, read files, send emails!</p>

            <div class="w-full lg:w-1/2">
                <p>I spent a few weeks using a free web host, to learn about classic ASP. What I really wanted to do, was send an email. Just a simple email. I had no idea about restrictions the web-host had setup. I didn't even know that was a thing they could do. The code snippet I used is still on w3schools, amazingly.</p>
                <p>I spent hours trying to get this snippet to work, and after searching for the millionth time about how to send an email with ASP, I got result for sending an email with PHP. Never heard of PHP before so I checked it out.</p>

            <div class="w-full lg:w-1/2">
                <p>How simple is that! Why on earth would I keep using ASP with it's 7 lines of code to send an email, when I could use 1 line of PHP! So I did what anyone would do. Wrote my application in ASP, with a single PHP file to send an email. Laugh now, but it worked.</p>
                <p>The simplicity of PHP drew me even closer to it. Eventually writing everything I did in PHP. Procedural of course. Then I started realising about restrictions on free web hosts. I was using Geocities at the time, and you could pay money to get more disk space, more bandwidth (?!) and you could use more PHP!</p>

        <div class="content-section white-section">
            <p>I asked my mum to buy me some hosting. It wasn't expensive, a few quid a month, but she didn't :( No surprise really, this was just something I was doing for fun, but cost money that we could spend on better things. Like food.</p>
            <p>Eventually I got a weekend job while still in school. It was horrible. Washing cars in a dirty, multistory carpark. 8am till 5.30 on saturdays, sometimes sundays, lugging 2 massive buckets of water up several flights of stairs, multiple times a day, in soaking wet overalls and worst of all, wet socks. Getting £1.50 for every car I did, while the boss charged £5. On an average, good day, I would get 10 cars. £15.00. </p>
            <p>Some of the money would go on bus fares. Some I would treat myself to a sugary snack or sausage rolls. Some of it I'd use to pay for cheap web hosting. Eventually I just wrote lots of PHP for fun. I did some really rubbish design work, creating templates and uploading them to a website others could download from for free. Still no real idea that I could actually turn it into a career.</p>

        <div class="content-section grey-section">
            <p class="page-title">Leaving school</p>
            <p>I always did pretty good in school. I was usually in the top classes in each subject, but never really did well in exams. I decided to take ICT, Chemistry and Physics A-levels. ICT A-levels were rubbish. The only real thing I can remember of it, was writing up "Safe Systems of Work" documents in Microsoft word, and how to create a basic database using Microsoft Access GUI. The databases interested me, but not enough to keep me from dropping it as a subject.</p>
            <p>The sciences were really interesting, but I kept getting confused with the math side of Physics, and dropped that as well, and since I only enjoyed Chemistry as a subject, but probably not as a career, I dropped out of A-levels completely after the first year.</p>
            <p>The first job I got was as a temporary employee for Royal Mail during the Christmas period. The job was pretty simple, and paid well (for my age). All I had to do, was turn up, sit at a computer, and type in the addresses of letters that appeared on screen. I eventually got interview to keep the job permanently.</p>
            <p>I spent about 5 years in that job. Fortunately, it was super early hours usually finishing between 10am and 2pm, leaving me with the rest of the day free. After a few years of it, I wanted something new, so started looking at programming again.</p>

        <div class="content-section white-section">
            <p class="page-title">First Developer Job</p>
            <p>I spent about a year teaching myself PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript and MySQL. After got all that down, I started learning about OOP, and as a little project for myself, I created my own little framework - because, who hasn't? This was all pre-composer. My deployment process was pretty much save files to local, and FTP them to a Plesk server.</p>
            <p>Eventually, I thought I'd learnt enough to start looking at it as a Career. I saw in the local paper that a secondary school about 35 miles away wanted a developer to build their website, so thinking it was pretty good introductory job to development, applied. My "coding test" was to suggest improvements to their current website in a powerpoint.</p>
            <p>Looking back, they probably just wanted a few annotated screenshots, but desperate to get into this career path, I rebuilt the entire website in a few days. I designed it in Photoshop, spliced it all up into seperate images, and put them back together with HTML tables. Awesome.</p>

            <p class="page-title">Leaving my first developer job</p>
            <p>I spent 4 years at Westlands. I went from having wrote my own framework to run the site, to using CodeIgniter, to my first introduction to Laravel. The school was using a Windows network, with on site filesystem servers, domain controllers and web servers. I was lucky enough to have 3 to myself. One for the public and internal tools I wrote in PHP. One for the virtual learning environment (Frog VLE), and one for another system which managed the Library.</p>
            <p>Because it was Windows, a lot of the server management and setup I did I was able to use the Windows Server GUI. Need to install a web server? Download and install WAMPserver. Everything was already configured, all I needed to do was drop in some PHP files.</p>
            <p>When I first looked at Laravel, it totally confused the hell out of me. Using the command line to download and install?! Composer?! What was all this! Eventually I got it up and running with a lot of hard work, by downloading and extracting the zip file from Github. I learnt just enough of composer to know how it worked, at a bare minimum.</p>
            <p>I spent about a year rewriting everything in Laravel. Over the previous 3 years, I'd written quite a lot of internal tools. Room booking applications, Activity booking applications, a kind of "panic" application for staff, etc. Over the year I got a good grasp (or at least I thought I did) on how Laravel and composer worked.</p>
            <p>At which point, the school hired an outside agency to redesign the website. Kinda a bummer. I'd spent ages doing all this stuff and without any kind of meeting, was pretty much replaced. So I started looking for a new job, and along came Crowdcube.</p>
            <p>Crowdcube looked amazing. They had a cool website, they were doing cool things. I applied and got a quick response back with a telephone call and some technical questions / coding task. It was pretty hardcore. I remember I was asked to write a sorting function to sort an array, and also asked whether to note the pros/cons of a "fan out on write" vs "fan out on read" approach to queuing.</p>
            <p>Neither of which I'd ever done before. I had no idea about either question, but I spent the weekend reading as much as I could and eventually replied. They seemed to like the answers because I got invited to an onsite interview with the head of engineering and the CTO.</p>
            <p>After the interview, I was pretty much offered the job straight away, and I accepted straight away. They were (and still are) a super cool company.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section grey-section">
            <p>I started at Crowdcube just a few weeks after the interview. I was at that stage in my career, that everyones been through, where you think you know everything, but in reality, you don't know anything.</p>
            <p>The first week at Crowdcube was pretty horrendous. Not because of the company, but because it was the biggest learning curve I've ever experienced. I had to, for the first time in my career, work in a team. Learn how to use Git (previous I was just FTPing like a pro). Learn how to read someone elses legacy code. And to top it off, lots of new technology I'd never known about. Local development environments, queues, deployments, AWS. All of it alien. That first week, I was extremely close to quitting and asking for my old job back.</p>
            <p>I'm also an introvert. So trying to engage with others was pretty hard. Fortunately, a couple people that worked in the office also caught the same train as me, and I quickly joined their little group. Everything felt a lot better after that. Interactions with other team members became easier, I spent evenings cramming as much knowledge as I could about everything that was confusing me. I spent hours looking through the legacy code base trying to understand it.</p>
            <p>The team at Crowdcube was amazing. It felt like a kind of family. Everyone was so relaxed, we had our social events, I even got asked if I wanted to go to Laracon in Amsterdam, with all expenses paid! I never knew that was a thing! Coming from Royal Mail, where you had to get every last minute of overtime signed for by a manager, to being flown out to another company, put up in a sweet hotel and getting paid to listen to people talk about stuff I really enjoyed.</p>
            <p>I carved myself out a little peice of Crowdcube, working mainly in the admin panel. I've found admin panels are pretty neglected. They don't bring in revenue compared to customer facing sites, but their still super important. I rewrote an entire feature using a new Laravel API. I deleted 1.5 million lines of unused code. But eventually I started wanting to do something different.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section white-section">
            <p class="page-title">Leaving Crowdcube, Joining Upad</p>
            <p>I got introduced to another company who were looking for a PHP developer. I went and spoke to them a couple of times, eventually after a while, I accepted the job and left Crowdcube. I won't name the company, but I spent about 2 and a half weeks there before leaving.</p>
            <p>Culturally, I didn't feel it was the right place for me. During the meetings, it sounded like a cool place to be part of. The people I would be working with were super clever, building these cool applications, but until I actually started working there, I didn't realise how out of sorts I'd be. Again, the company wasn't bad. They were doing good stuff, but after 2 weeks, I knew it wasn't a place I could stay at.</p>
            <p>Fortunately, I got offered a job with another company pretty soon after a helping hand from an ex-colleague from Crowdcube, and some devs that still worked there. It was a remote position, something I've never done before, working for a property letting company in London.</p>
            <p>I had a 2 year old, so being remote meant I didn't have to spend time commuting on a train, and could spend more time at home. It felt pretty similar to Crowdcube, just less mature. They still had a legacy codebase, looking to move it to a new API. The team was pretty small, but it was close. Every month we'd travel up to London to work in the office for 3 days.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section grey-section">
            <p class="page-title">Next steps</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the company had to make some redundancies, and I decided to leave. So here I am, on my notice period. I've just been offered a new job, still remote, but as a promotion to senior developer.</p>
            <p>Something I've wanted to do for a long time now, is to help mentor junior developers. Since I started writing PHP around version 3, backend development (and even frontend) has has become insane. The entry barrier has become so high, I wouldn't be surprised if lots of people turn away from development as a career path.</p>
            <p>So hopefully, starting this new job, I'll be able to provide some years of experience to those that want to look at programming, or those that have already got that first job, but are still unsure. I never went to University. I dropped out of A-levels, and there's been times that have been so stressful I've considered running away from programming and never looking back. But I really believe that any developer, regardless of experience should do all they can to help those with less experience. So, good luck.</p>
